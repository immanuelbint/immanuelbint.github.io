# Pipeline Scanner: Prevent Credential Leaks in CI/CD Pipelines

The pipeline-scanner is a lightweight Bash-based tool designed for DevOps engineers, SREs, and system administrators to audit CI/CD pipeline configuration files (e.g., YAML, Jenkinsfiles) for hardcoded credentials, such as secrets, tokens, or passwords. By catching sensitive data before itâ€™s committed, this tool enhances security and prevents costly leaks, making it an essential utility for any pipeline management workflow.

## Problem

Hardcoding credentials in pipeline configuration files (e.g., docker-compose.yml, .github/workflows/*.yml, or Jenkinsfile) can lead to accidental leaks when files are pushed to repositories. This exposes sensitive information, such as API tokens or passwords, to unauthorized users.

## Goal

To prevent leaks of sensitive information by identifying hardcoded credentials in pipeline files before they are committed or deployed.

## Solution

The pipeline-scanner script automates the detection of hardcoded credentials using a lightweight, Bash-based approach. It scans for common keywords (e.g., aws_, slack_, password) and provides clear feedback to help secure your CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Features

- Scans `.yml`, `.yaml`, and `Jenkinsfile` by default
- Detects keywords like `aws_`, `slack_`, `github_`, `token`, `password`, `secret`
- Logs progress with clear output (`INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR`)
- Fails gracefully with meaningful error messages
- Works with any target directory (default: current workdir)


---

## Script Example:

Create a file named `pipeline-scanner.sh` and paste the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

TARGET=${1:-"."}
CLEAN=0
ISSUE=0

## Setup logging
function log() {
  if [[ -n "${LOG:-}" ]]; then
    printf '%s\n' "$*" | tee -a "$LOG" >&2
  else
    printf '%s\n' "$*" >&2
  fi
}
function fatal() { log "ERROR: $*"; exit 1; }

## Scanning if there's still secrets intact on yaml files
function grep_keyword() {
    local file="$1"
    set +e
    grep -q -E '(aws_|slack_|github_|token|password|secret)' "$file"
    local status=$?

    if [[ $status == 0 ]]; then
        ((ISSUE++))
        log "WARN: Found secrets in $file, avoid hardcoding sensitive data"
    elif [[ $status == 1 ]]; then
        ((CLEAN++))
        log "INFO: File $file is clean"
    else
        fatal "Failed to scan file, check either file permission or checksum if its corrupted"
    fi
}

## Check if yaml file exist before scan
function scan_files() {
    local count="$1"
    if [[ "${count}" == 0 ]]; then
        log "INFO: No YAML/CI files found, skipping scan."
        return 1
    else
        return 0
    fi
}

## Loop through files on current workdir
function scan_path() {
    local TARGET="$1"
    local FILES
    FILES=$(find "$TARGET" -type f \( -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "Jenkinsfile" \))

    local COUNT
    COUNT=$(find "$TARGET" -type f \( -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "Jenkinsfile" \) | wc -l)
    scan_files "$COUNT"
    log "INFO: Found $COUNT file(s) to be scanned."

    for FILE in $FILES; do
        log "INFO: Scanning file $FILE"
        grep_keyword "$FILE"
    done
}

## Main function
function main() {
    log "Starting the scanner ..."
    log "INFO: Scanning directory $TARGET"
    
    scan_path "$TARGET"

    log "INFO: Scan finished."
    log "INFO: $CLEAN file(s) clean."
    log "WARN: $ISSUE file(s) with issues."
}

main
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
bash pipeline-scanner.sh 

# Scan a specific directory or file
bash pipeline-scanner.sh /path/to/project
```

Example output

```bash
$ bash pipeline-scanner.sh /data/l2bot
Starting the scanner ...
INFO: Scanning directory /data/l2bot/
INFO: Found 1 file(s) to be scanned.
INFO: Scanning file /data/l2bot/docker-compose.yml
INFO: File /data/l2bot/docker-compose.yml is clean
INFO: Scan finished.
INFO: 1 file(s) clean.
WARN: 0 file(s) with issues.
```

Example with issue
```bash
$ bash pipeline-scanner.sh /data/project
Starting the scanner ...
INFO: Scanning directory /data/project/
INFO: Found 2 file(s) to be scanned.
INFO: Scanning file /data/project/.github/workflows/ci.yml
WARN: Found secrets in /data/project/.github/workflows/ci.yml, avoid hardcoding sensitive data
INFO: Scanning file /data/project/Jenkinsfile
INFO: File /data/project/Jenkinsfile is clean
INFO: Scan finished.
INFO: 1 file(s) clean.
WARN: 1 file(s) with issues.
```

## Requirements

* Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, RHEL, CentOS
* Root/sudo access (if the target directory requires elevated permissions)

---

## What It Does

1. Automatically detects current path if not specified
2. Outputs success or error messages

---

## Future Improvements

- Add option for custom keyword patterns
- Export scan results to JSON/CSV for CI integration
- Add affected file name and which creds hardcoded
- Add Git pre-commit hook support
- Colorized output (green/red logs)
