# Automating `kinit` Using Shell Script

## Problem

In Kerberized environments, authenticating as a specific Hadoop service user requires running `kinit` with the corresponding keytab. Doing this repeatedly for different services manually is time consuming and error prone, especially in large scale systems.

## Goal

To reduce repetition by automating the `kinit` process based on available service keytabs, while still allowing manual override when needed.

---

## Solution – Bash Script for Flexible `kinit`

## Features:
- Auto-detect service name and keytab location from a predefined list.
- Allow manual override for custom services.
- Validate keytab file existence before attempting authentication.
- Print success/failure feedback.

---

## Script Example

Create a file named `kinit.sh` and paste the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
## Setup logging
function log() {
  if [[ -n "${LOG:-}" ]]; then
    printf '%s\n' "$*" | tee -a "$LOG" >&2
  else
    printf '%s\n' "$*" >&2
  fi
}
function fatal() { log "ERROR: $*"; exit 1; }

## Declare known keytabs in an associative array
declare -A KEYTABS
KEYTABS["hdfs"]="/etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab"
KEYTABS["yarn"]="/etc/security/keytabs/yarn.service.keytab"
KEYTABS["hbase"]="/etc/security/keytabs/hbase.service.keytab"
KEYTABS["hive"]="/etc/security/keytabs/hive.service.keytab"
KEYTABS["storm"]="/etc/security/keytabs/storm.headless.keytab"
KEYTABS["kafka"]="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka.service.keytab"
KEYTABS["solr"]="/etc/security/keytabs/solr.service.keytab"
KEYTABS["spark"]="/etc/security/keytabs/spark.service.keytab"

## Get service name input
read -r -p "Enter service name you'd like to kinit => " response
response=$(echo "$response" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

## Check if service exists
if [[ -n "${KEYTABS[$response]}" ]]; then
    keytab_path="${KEYTABS[$response]}"
else
    log "Service not found. Would you like to specify a custom keytab?"
    read -r -p "(y/n) => " userinput
    if [[ "$userinput" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        read -r -p "Enter full path to keytab => " keytab_path
    else
        exit 0
    fi
fi

## Validate keytab and perform kinit
if [[ -f "$keytab_path" ]]; then
    principal=$(klist -kt "$keytab_path" | grep @ | awk '{print $NF}' | head -n 1)
    if [[ -n "$principal" ]]; then
        kinit -kt "$keytab_path" "$principal"
        log "INFO: Successfully authenticated with keytab: $keytab_path"
    else
        fatal "No principal found in keytab."
    fi
else
    fatal "Keytab file not found at $keytab_path"
fi
````

## Usage

1. **Make the script executable:**

```bash
chmod +x kinit.sh
```

2. **Run the script:**

```bash
bash kinit.sh
```

## Notes and Improvements

> This script is part of an ongoing learning project and may not fully reflect best practices. Future improvements include:
>
> * Adding support for JSON-based config files.
> * Full automation using arguments (e.g. `--service=hdfs`).
> * Improved error handling and logging.
> * Secure credential handling via environment variables or vault integration.
>
> I'm actively improving this script toward production-ready standards.
