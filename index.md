## 🧭 Overview

This documentation is my way to:

- 🧠 **Reconnect ideas** across projects and time
- 📚 **Learn in public** and improve my technical writing
- 🔍 Provide a practical **reference** for myself and others
- 🌍 Build a portfolio aligned with my **goal to work abroad**

> 💡 *Think of this like my second brain. Only cleaner and version-controlled.*
