## Overview

This documentation is my way to:

- **Reconnect ideas** across projects and time
- **Learn in public** and improve my technical writing
- Provide a practical **reference** for myself and others
- Build a portfolio aligned with my **goal to work abroad**

> *Think of this like my second brain. Only cleaner and version-controlled.*
